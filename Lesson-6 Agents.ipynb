    "An AI agent is a software program designed to autonomously perform tasks on behalf of a user or another system. These agents interact with their environment, perceive data through sensors, process information, and execute actions using actuators to achieve specific . \n",
    "\n",
    "The operation of an AI agent typically follows a four-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Perception**: The agent gathers information about its environment through sensors or data inputs. This is achieved by an interface, like the chat interface of a chat-app, or an API\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Decision-Making**: Based on the perceived data, the agent processes the information to make informed decisions. This is performed by a LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Action**: Perform operations such as sending responses, triggering workflows, modifying the environment, or doing function calling\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Learning**:  Mechanisms for performance evaluation and iterative improvement\n",
    "It consists of an interface (step 1), and a workflow (steps 2 to 4)"

He is a founder and former chair of the Machine Learning Department at CMU. Mitchell is known for his contributions to the advancement of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cognitive neuroscience and is the author of the textbook Machine Learning. He is a member of the United States National Academy of Engineering since 2010. He is also a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a Fellow and past president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.
